# Stackoverflow: How to formulate questions, i.e. Matthew 7:12

## A twenty-step guide to get you started:

1. Preparation:

1. Do some research beforehand, has the problem been solved already?
2. Explain steps you've already taken; try to implement at least a few solutions that you find online.
3. Double check your syntax.
4. Make sure to specify your exact expectations with the code.
5. Try to provide context as to your coding level. Remember! People want to help.


2. Giving all the required info

1. Important! Break down what exactly is going wrong, and try to present the essence.
2. Give complete code and make sure others can replicate the problem.
3. Format your code correctly, provide clean code.
4. Is your question understandable without code? Shouldn't you include code?
5. Specify language and program + versions.
6. Is there an exception? If so, make sure to include the message and stack trace.
7. Are there more specific and relevant things you need to include? If your question is related to anything locale-specific (languages, time zones) have you stated the relevant information about your system (e.g. your current time zone)?

3. Almost finished:

1. Double-check formatting.
2. Check spelling and grammar (but not really).
3. Reread the question, does it still make sense, or have you rubber ducked it?
4. Question title should be a question, people want to read prose, not 1s and 0s.

4. Done!

1. Check your thread, and implement suggestions; keep it alive!
2. Update your progress and iterate. 
2. Thank the people that have helped you; stay polite.
